        A neutral, portable identity and context layer that sits above individual AI models and providers.

    <section class="sb-section" id="problem">
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        AI interactions today are fragmented. Each product and provider maintains its own partial view of the user,
        binding identity and behavior to specific accounts, models, or user interfaces. Long-term memory is scattered,
        brittle, or controlled by vendors, making privacy, portability, and continuity difficult to guarantee.
      </p>
      <p>There is no neutral infrastructure layer that allows a user’s AI identity and context to be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Owned by the user</li>
        <li>Portable across engines and providers</li>
        <li>Stable over time, even as models change</li>
      </ul>
      <p>StarBridge exists to solve that problem.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="sb-section" id="architecture">
      <h2>StarBridge Architecture (High-Level)</h2>
      <p>
        StarBridge is defined by the StarBridge Master Development Language (MDL) and implemented through six core modules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Core File (CF)</strong> — Portable, user-owned identity and context artifact.</li>
        <li><strong>SYNC (Cross-Model Sync Layer)</strong> — Synchronizes identity and memory across heterogeneous AI engines.</li>
        <li><strong>Runtime (RT)</strong> — Loads the Core File, configures engines, and enforces global invariants.</li>
        <li><strong>Identity-as-a-Service (IaaS)</strong> — Exposes limited identity slices to external applications under explicit policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptive Cognitive Layer (ACL)</strong> — Maintains behavioral and cognitive consistency across models and versions.</li>
        <li><strong>Fractured Identity Protocol (FIP)</strong> — Stores identity as encrypted micro-shards with no reconstructable state at rest.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="sb-inline-diagram">
        Core File → Runtime → SYNC → { IaaS, ACL, FIP }
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="sb-section" id="properties">
      <h2>Key Properties</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Portable Identity</strong> — Identity and long-term context are encoded in a Core File independent of any AI provider.</li>
        <li><strong>Model & Vendor Neutrality</strong> — Designed to run against multiple commercial and local models via adapters.</li>
        <li><strong>Behavioral Consistency</strong> — ACL maintains a stable persona across model updates and vendors.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy-First Architecture</strong> — FIP stores identity as encrypted shards, reconstructable only inside a validated runtime.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance-Friendly</strong> — Clear separation of identity, memory, and engine layers supports audit and policy enforcement.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="sb-section" id="use-cases">
      <h2>Example Use Cases</h2>
      <p>StarBridge is infrastructure for organizations that need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Multi-model identity</strong> across engines and providers</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy-sensitive deployments</strong> requiring FIP-level guarantees</li>
        <li><strong>Stable evaluation environments</strong> for consistent personas</li>
        <li><strong>Platform-level integrations</strong> via limited, policy-scoped identity slices</li>
      </ul>
